# Project Travel Log

## Traveler's Log

An application that allows users to write a summary of their trip and upload a photo of the place they've been.

## How To Use

When you click 'Add New Log,' a new page will load with information that has to be entered. Once finished, click "Submit," and the record will be added to the system.

The main page would display all of the entries made thus far. If you click on the title of the entry, it will load all of the information that was supplied.
